# Tasks: Secure Agent Access

**Input**: Design documents from `specs/001-secure-agent-access/`

**Prerequisites**: `plan.md`, `spec.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`

**Tests**: Required by the project constitution for security-sensitive behavior. Write the listed
tests first and confirm they fail before the matching implementation.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel because it changes separate files and has no incomplete dependency.
- **[Story]**: Maps work to a user story in `spec.md`.
- Every task names its target file or directory.

## Phase 1: Setup

**Purpose**: Establish the native project, test layout, and reproducible build surface.

- [X] T001 Create SwiftPM products and dependency graph from `plan.md` in `Package.swift`
- [X] T002 Create the broker, CLI, AskPass, and native runtime aggregate targets in `Apps/SAFA/SAFA.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
- [X] T003 [P] Add Debug and Release signing/build settings in `Apps/SAFA/Config/BuildSettings.xcconfig`
- [X] T004 [P] Add component Info.plist and entitlement templates in `Apps/SAFA/Config/`
- [X] T005 [P] Create unit, contract, integration, security, and fixture directories under `Tests/`
- [X] T006 [P] Add Swift format/lint and strict-concurrency configuration in `.swift-format` and `Package.swift`
- [X] T007 [P] Add macOS build and test workflow without signing secrets in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- [X] T008 Document third-party license obligations for Swift Argument Parser in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`

---

## Phase 2: Foundational

**Purpose**: Implement contracts and security abstractions that block every user story.

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story implementation starts until this phase passes its tests.

- [X] T009 [P] Add failing Codable snapshot tests for CLI envelope and errors in `Tests/Contract/CLIEnvelopeContractTests.swift`
- [X] T010 [P] Add failing domain validation and state-transition tests in `Tests/Unit/DomainStateTests.swift`

- [X] T020 [P] Add failing XPC peer identity and unauthorized-client tests in `Tests/Integration/XPCPeerValidationTests.swift`
- [X] T021 Define separate Agent-client and trusted-local XPC protocols in `Sources/SAFAProtocol/BrokerXPCProtocol.swift`
- [X] T022 Implement peer signing, effective-user, and audit-session validation in `Sources/SAFABroker/PeerValidator.swift`
- [X] T023 Implement the per-user broker listener and bounded request dispatcher in `Sources/SAFABroker/BrokerService.swift`
- [X] T024 [P] Implement sanitized OSLog events with private-by-default fields in `Sources/SAFABroker/SecurityLog.swift`
- [X] T025 [P] Add an in-memory fake vault, fake approval provider, and fake transport in `Tests/Fixtures/Fakes/`
- [ ] T026 Wire the broker launch-agent payload to a reviewed, system-authenticated no-GUI
  activation flow; `Apps/SAFA/BrokerLaunchAgent/` currently contains only the payload

**Checkpoint**: Protocol, encrypted state, peer validation, and deterministic test doubles work
without a real server or credential.

MVP, even before arbitrary elevated command approval is added.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Run an Arbitrary Command with Scoped Approval (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Preserve arbitrary `exec`, shell, pipeline, redirect, TTY, and sudo capability while binding
authority to a reviewed request and trusted local approval.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Protect Inventory and Limit Compromise Impact (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Demonstrate that open source, copied local files, and compromise of one managed host do not
expose the remaining infrastructure or reusable cross-host credentials.

**Independent Test**: Copy/tamper/rollback the vault and compromise one of two synthetic hosts; verify
no other endpoint-and-credential combination becomes usable.

**Checkpoint**: Security claims are supported by tests and do not overpromise protection after full
local administrator compromise.

---

**Goal**: Deliver the Skill-first installation and Agent workflow without Homebrew, raw secrets,
unverified downloads, or unsafe interpretation of remote output.

**Independent Test**: Install the built Skill into a clean profile, trigger it with a NAS health
request, complete trusted setup, and execute through the pinned signed runtime.

- [ ] T084 [US4] Run an independent clean-profile Skill journey and record fixtures in `Tests/Contract/SkillBehaviorTests.md`

**Checkpoint**: A user installs one Skill artifact and the Agent reliably uses SAFA without external
package-manager setup.

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Review and Revoke Access (Priority: P5)

**Goal**: Let the user reconstruct sanitized activity, verify audit continuity, inspect grants, and
revoke authority immediately.

**Independent Test**: Generate allowed, denied, approved, failed, expired, and revoked actions; verify
the chain and prove no credential appears in UI, CLI, or export.

### Tests for User Story 5

revocable without exposing secrets.

---

---

## Dependencies and Execution Order

### Phase dependencies

- **Setup**: starts immediately.
- **Foundational**: depends on Setup and blocks all user stories.
- **US1**: depends only on Foundational and defines the diagnostic MVP.
- **US2**: depends on Foundational; integrates with US1 transport/resource services but its policy,
  grant, and approval components can be developed against fakes.
- **US3**: depends on Foundational; recovery UI builds on US1 onboarding but cryptographic and blast-
  radius tests can start independently.
- **US4**: depends on a runnable US1 runtime for full validation; Skill files and package tests can
  begin after Foundational.
- **US5**: depends on Foundational; full incident reconstruction validation uses US1/US2 events.
- **Polish**: depends on every story selected for the release.

### User story completion order

```text
Setup -> Foundational -> US1 (MVP)
                        ├-> US2 -> US5 full validation
                        ├-> US3
                        └-> US4
All selected stories -> Polish
```

### Within each user story

1. Write the listed tests and confirm they fail for the intended reason.
2. Implement independent models/services in parallel where marked `[P]`.
3. Integrate through the versioned contracts.
4. Run the story's independent test before starting a dependent story.

## Parallel Execution Examples

### User Story 1

```text
T027 resource CLI contract || T028 onboarding || T029 host identity || T030 enclave || T031 askpass
T033 registry || T035 trusted no-GUI registration || T036 enclave key || T037 password credential
```

### User Story 2

```text
T047 policy || T048 command canonicalization || T049 grant binding || T050 approval || T051 sudo
T053 canonicalizer || T054 policy engine || T058 trusted local approval workflow
```

### User Stories 3-5 after the MVP

```text
US3 vault/recovery hardening || US4 Skill packaging || US5 audit and revocation
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP first

1. Complete T001-T026.
2. Complete T027-T046.
3. Stop and validate the P1 journey with synthetic `nas.home`.
4. Do not call the build production-ready yet: arbitrary approval, recovery, packaging hardening, and
   complete audit UX are intentionally later increments.

### Incremental delivery

1. **0.1 diagnostic preview**: Foundation + US1 on synthetic/test resources.
2. **0.2 controlled operations**: add US2 and exact/session approvals.
3. **0.3 security preview**: add US3, US4, and US5.
4. **1.0**: complete Phase 8, notarized Skill artifact, adversarial evidence, and release checklist.

## Notes

- Never place real hostnames, IPs, usernames, passwords, keys, tokens, host fingerprints, or jump
  routes in source, tests, fixtures, issues, CI output, or task evidence.
- Development-only peer/signature bypasses must be compile-time excluded from Release builds.
- An approved root shell is intentionally powerful; scope, expiry, visibility, and audit are the
  mitigation, not misleading command classification.
- Commit after each task or coherent test-first group and keep contract changes backward compatible
  within `dev.safa.cli/v1`.
